Holds firmware for Stocker's motion chip board by Pit Gebbers using SiLabs C8051F320. 
This a full-blown USB driver/firmware combo that
uses the Thesycon driver on the host side. It goes with a Java class
on the host side.

NOTE: This project is built with the SiLabs IDE >v1.9. It must be built in a folder
without any spaces in the PATH to the folder, i.e., move it to C:\ to build it.
The downloaded firmware is the file OMF file "FIRMWARE".

This project was derived from the basic USB interrupt example from SiLabs.

Program Description:
-------------------

This firmware is intended to work with the Silabs USB Bulk File Transfer 
example, implementing two Bulk pipes with 64-byte Maximum transfers. The 
endpoints used are as follows:

Endpoint1 IN - BULK IN
Endpoint2 OUT - BULK OUT

How To Test:
-----------

1) Download the code to any C8051F32x target board using the Silicon Labs IDE
2) Run the GUI application that comes with the firmware and test the features


Known Issues and Limitations:
----------------------------
	
1)  Firmware works with the Silicon Labs IDE v1.71 or later and the 
	Keil C51 tool chain. Project and code modifications will be 
	necessary for use with different tool chains.

2)  Compiler optimization emphasis is selected as "favor small code". 
	This selection is necessary for the project to be compiled with the 
	trial version of the Keil C51 Compiler (under 4k code space).

3)  If using the C8051F320TB target board, jumper J2 should be 
	installed if the board is wall-powered;
	jumper J11 should be installed if bus-powered.

4)  Windows application and driver supports Win2K, XP, and 98 only.

  Groups events together according their spatial and temporal closeness.

LabelingFilter
The filter LabelingFilter uses an approach very similar to binary image labeling to form groups. It uses the temporal disance between neighbouring events to decide whether they are in the same group or not. If the distance is below a temporal threshold the groups are considered to be in the same group. Like in image labeling the neighourhood is defined as either 4- or 8-neighbourhood.

The Filter has the following parameters:
<blockquote>
. drawingrotated - enables to draw the output of the filter based on the rotations made with the mouse [boolean]
. drawingtemporalresolution - temporal resolution used for the drawing [us]
. drawingtemporalmemory - time for which the result will be visible [us]
. drawingminsize - minsize for a event group to be drawn [#pixels]
. temporalthreshold - maximal temporal distance between the events in the same group [us]
. temporaldelay - time delay for events to be outputed [us]

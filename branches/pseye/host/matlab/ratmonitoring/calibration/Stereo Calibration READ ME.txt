How To calibrate stereo retinae :

1. Acquire at least 8 pictures of the checkerboard pattern at different depth, face toward the cameras
   We need to get "frames" of the checkerboard, so we record then obstuct the view with a with or black homogeneous shutter


2. Play back the files using StereoDisplay filters for each retina, each showing only one of the two retinas.

   We pause when the accumulated pictures shows the checkerboard grid with enough contrast, then press L in each of the StereoDisplay frame to log the frame into a .jpg file. Then press . and . again in the main jaer display to finish the logging.

3. copy in left and right subfolders of a calibration folder and optionnaly use an Image editor software to threshold the images 

4. Run Matlab, go to each folder and run calib.
   Choose Standard
   Then "Image Names" (without the number)
   Then Extract Grid Corners (Measure checkerboard pattern size before), 3x3 corner size is good, or 1x1
   Then Calibration
   Then Save

5. Rename Calib_Results.mat files into  Calib_Results_left.mat and  Calib_Results_right.mat and move them one folder up
   In Matlab run stereo)gui in this folder
   - Load left and right calibration files  (the matlab script is modify to load images from subfolders droite and gauche, to change.
   - Run stereo calibration
   - Save stereo calib results

   - Important : rectify the calibration images (this script is modified to generate index files to be used by the java EpiloarRectification filter)
  

   - copy the files indices_droite, .._gauche, indices_new .. into /host/java [only for epipolar rectification]
   - create the file calibstereo.txt in /host/java from the intrinsic parameters given by stereo_gui
   - use rodrigues(om) to get retina rotation matrix, some version requires inversion of sgn of some elements of rotation vector
- keep world rotation as is unless recomputed


6. create fundamental.txt file!
      in matlab after stereo calibration : F = getfundamental(KK_left,KK_right,R,T)

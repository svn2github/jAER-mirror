//TODO: BjoernBeyer: The speed is not correct! The UnitDirs in MotionOrientationEvent.unitDirs
//      are not really UnitVectors (the diagonal vectors are not) This means that the speed for the 
//      diagonal events is actually higher than computed here, as the euclidian distance the edge must have travelled
//      is larger than the search distance 's' (by a factor of sqrt2).   
//
//      This also means, that the diagonals are underrepresented in general, as the 'dt' for diagonals will
//      be larger than for the horizontals and verticals, since the search distance is larger. So for the same
//      actual motion speed the reported dt for diagonal motion will be larger than for the other directions.
//       This means we should increase the search distance in the speed calculation by a factor of sqrt2 and 
//       also incearse the min/maxDtThreshold by the same factor for the diagonal orientations. 
//                        
//      Note however that the velocity currently is correct, as in the diagonal cases we are multiplying the 
//      too small speed with a too large unitvector, both are of by a factor of sqrt2. Hence the velocity is 
//      correct for all directions. If the speed calculation is fixed however the velocity needs to be adjusted as well!  
//      -------------------
//      I hacked arround the dt Threshold Problem. Infact the diagonal directions where pretty much underrepresented.
//      From rough estimations the measured speed for the same PHYSICAL speed was 30% lower for diagonal motion (rotated with the rotation filter)
//      than for horizontal or vertical motion. With the Threshold problem removed the speeds are 
//      acutally the same, as the annotated speed is based on the velocity, not the speed of the event.

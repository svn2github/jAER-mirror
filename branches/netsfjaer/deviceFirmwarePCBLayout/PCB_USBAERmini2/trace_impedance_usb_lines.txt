Differential Trace impedance of USB lines on PCB should be 90 ohms.

constants:
material (FR3): epsilon_r 4.9
thickness: 1.464 mm
track thickness 0.018mm

calculated with:

usb track width: 0.4mm
usb track clearance 0.2mm

usb track clearance from polygon 0.2mm

resulting diff impedance 98 ohms

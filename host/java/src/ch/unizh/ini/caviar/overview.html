      <p>
      
  This library uses devices (so far USB devices) to monitor (and depending on device, sequence)
  Address-Events and to control on-chip bias generators.
  The two interface devices first supported are the Silicon Labs C8051F320, a USB1 single chip microcontroller, 
  and the Cypress FX2 and FX2LP
  USB2 micros, which can pipe data at USB2 rate but need more board components.
  <p>It also has extensive support for rendering events using high performance OpenGL graphics
in 2d or 3d space-time, logging events to disk, playing them back, multicasting event packets and 
opening a multicast input. It supports simultaneous capture and playback from multiple heterogeneous devices, 
and algorithmic digital processing of events.</p>
  
  <h2>USB 1 or 2</h2>
  
  The USB1 SiLabs device is great because you can make a single-chip (single component actually, voltage regulator, oscillator, etc are included on-chip) system.
  At present the drawback of using this component is that everything must pass through the 8051 controller and the interface is USB1, which is 12Mbps. These limitations
  mean that event monitoring maxes out at about 120keps. The other drawback of the present firmware and host software implementation is that
  it is based on the easy-to-use but limited SiLabs USBXPress combination. Thus we have no specification for the host-side transfers available and so we
  must use the SiLabs host USBXPress driver, which has no vender-supported USB java interface and thus is only supported by a custom JNI interface written by Tobi. This
  DLL only supports a single device per machine.
  
  The USB2 interface is a little more complicated to build as a board but offers vastly more functionality and bandwidth. It is based on the flexible
  Cypress FX2 and FX2LP chips, which are widely used by people wanting to build custom USB2 interfaces. The use of this chip is complex, however! The datasheet
  is about 500 pages long and large parts of it must be understood for effective use.
  
  <h2>AE chips</h2>
  
  This software also supports an arbitrary number of types of AE chips. The chip connected to the hardware interface is defined
  by an AEChip subclass.
  
  <p>
      A chip can also be rendered by a variety of DisplayMethod's.

    The use of the EBR block asynchronous reset requires that certain timing

GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The local reset signal 'ResetxRBI_c' of the design has been inferred as
        Global Set Reset (GSR). The reset signal used for GSR control is
        'ResetxRBI_c'.

GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.

Components on inferred reset domain with GSR Property disabled
--------------------------------------------------------------

These components have the GSR property set to DISABLED and are on the inferred
     reset domain. The components will respond to the reset signal 'ResetxRBI_c'
     via the local reset on the component and not the GSR component.

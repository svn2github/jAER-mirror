@W: MT531 :"e:\jaer_svn\devices\logic\latticeecp3\seebetterlogic\fx3_omc - pipelined\mullercelement.vhd":44:1:44:4|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 1 sequential elements including OMCellSM.AcknowledgeCElement.Cout.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.

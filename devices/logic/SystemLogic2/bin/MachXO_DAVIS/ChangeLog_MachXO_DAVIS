Revision 6616 - 08.05.2015
- DVSAER: add ExternalAERControl configuration parameter
  to have external AER masters control the AER bus, for
  example other boards via the CAVIAR connector.
- ExtInput: add HasGenerator configuration parameter
  to check for generator presence.
- SPIConfig: fixed bug that would leave the SPI state
  machine stuck in the stInput state and wrongly then
  drive a logic low value onto the bus full-time,
  disrupting communication for other SPI slave devices.
  (Only ECP3_FX3 boards are visibly affected by this.)

Revision 6565 - 04.05.2015
- Initial release.

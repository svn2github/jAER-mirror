Revision 6906 - 29.06.2015
- Use VHDL range attribute in all files.
- ExtInput: specify length values in cycles directly
  instead of 100ns slices. This is more precise and
  avoids costly multipliers.
- APSADC: use ADC clock frequency value to derive
  configuration parameter widths and values.

Revision 6791 - 29.05.2015
- DVSAER: rewrote RowOnly filter and moved it to be
  executed as last stage after the main state machine.
  This has no functional implications for FX2 devices
  currently sold.

Revision 6735 - 21.05.2015
- APSADC: several changes to accomodate fast pipelined
  readout on new FX3 devices. No functional changes for
  FX2 devices currently sold.

Revision 6616 - 08.05.2015
- DVSAER: add ExternalAERControl configuration parameter
  to have external AER masters control the AER bus, for
  example other boards via the CAVIAR connector.
- ExtInput: add HasGenerator configuration parameter
  to check for generator presence.
- SPIConfig: fixed bug that would leave the SPI state
  machine stuck in the stInput state and wrongly then
  drive a logic low value onto the bus full-time,
  disrupting communication for other SPI slave devices.
  (Only ECP3_FX3 boards are visibly affected by this.)

Revision 6565 - 04.05.2015
- Initial release.

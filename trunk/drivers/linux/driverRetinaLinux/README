This linux kernel usb driver was developed by Martin Ebner, IGI, TU Graz.
(ebner@igi.tugraz.at)
The driver for address event devices ("spiking retina") supports
currently only the DVS128 dynamic vision sensor.
this is part of the sourceforge project jAER by Toby Delbruck,
Patrick Lichtensteiner, Raphel Berner and more,...

driver specs:
*1Meps bandwidth
*unknown latency (somewhere in the 0.1-50ms range)
 [<100us can be reached with the rt linux kernel. of course,
  both kernel driver and user space algorithm must comply with
  the realtime programming guidelines for this. depends also 
  on the system hardware]
*<100us timestamp precision
*system call interface, using open/read/write calls. the
 device file is /dev/retina0 or /dev/usbdevices/retina0 symlink.
*automatic driver build / installation / autoload in kubuntu + debian.
*registered device accessible to all members of the "video" group.
*jAER integration

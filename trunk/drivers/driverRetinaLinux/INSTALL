Basic Installation
==================


***(k)ubuntu, debian, .. linux:***

installed packages: kernel-headers make

1.) type: make && sudo make install
*) create a group called "video" and add all users, which should have access to
the retina /dev/retina0. On standard linux installations this is already done.
(the udev rule in "make install" automatically detects
the retina and sets the group of "/dev/retina0" to "video")

>grep video /etc/group 
>>video:x:44:myuser,...(ok)

this will do it, at least on (k)ubuntu + debian

see also the Makefile script


***opensuse: ***

1.)installed packages: 
make 
kernel-pae(or kernel-rt), update to newest
kernel-syms

2.)
cd path.to/driverRetinaLinux
cp Makefile.opensuse Makefile
make && sudo make install #(or use the jAERViewer.sh for auto build)

*)group video for user should already exist


***autobuild***

'../../jAERViewer.sh' builds the driver and starts jAER.

Basic Installation
==================


*** tested on 2.6.24 kubuntu and fedora core linux:***

installed packages: kernel-headers make

1.) type: make && sudo make install

see also the 'Makefile' script


***tested on 2.6.25 opensuse: ***

1.)installed packages: 
make 
kernel-pae(or kernel-rt), update to newest
kernel-syms

2.)
cd path.to/driverRetinaLinux
cp Makefile.opensuse Makefile
make && sudo make install #(or use the jAERViewer.sh for auto build)

***autobuild***

'../../jAERViewer.sh' builds the driver and starts jAER.



***what the installation routine does***

make:

*)it builds the kernel module using the 'make' (with gnu c++) command.
the kernel version (i.e. 2.6.24xx) must be the same for:
a)the kernel binary, which is loaded at system startup (kernel-xx package)
b)the kernel source or linux headers, wich the kernel module is compiled with 
(kernel-headers or kernel-source package)
The file 'Module.symvers' is needed. Either it is in the kernel-headers or
in the kernle-source directory. (/usr/src/...) Custom kernels should also
generate a Module.symvers file, when compiled.
Without Module.symvers, the driver dependencies are not included. (So
the retina module doesnt know to start the usbcore module, on which it
depends)

make install:

*)copies the module 'retina.ko' to its standard location 
/lib/modules/2.6.24xx/kernel/drivers/video/
*)rebuilds the dependency file for modules (depmod -a)
*)copies the udev rule '88-retina.rules' to /etc/udev/rules.d and
restarts udev: in this rule, udev will detect a plugged in retina
and give the device file /dev/retina0 read rights
*)***load the module retina (modprobe retina)***
*)adding the modprobe retina command at boot time is different
for each linux distribution:
*)on (k)ubuntu/debian distributions this is done by 'make install'
*)on fedora core distribution the retina module is loaded automatically
when the retina is plugged in, without any boot script
*)on opensuse and other distros the 'modprobe retina' command has to
be added to a boot script in the /etc/init.d folder

@W: MT531 :"e:\jaer_svn\trunk\devicefirmwarepcblayout\latticeecp3\sbret20\sourcecode\usbaer_top_level.vhd":680:4:680:5|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 2 sequential elements including AERReqSyncxSBN.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.

This is Cypress FX2LP 8051 firmware for the SeeBetter chips SeeBetter10/11 at least,
probably for later chips as well. It is cloned off from firmware for cDVSTest
but has it's own USB product ID (PID) 0x840b in order that these devices can be
cleanly enumerated and assigned the appropriate jAER HardwareInterface.

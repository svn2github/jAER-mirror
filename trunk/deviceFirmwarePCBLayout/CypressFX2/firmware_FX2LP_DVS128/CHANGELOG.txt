DVS 128 firmware versions:

0010 Changed early packet timer to 1ms (it was 4ms) to reduce latency for low rate situations. Fixed bug where timestamps could be nonmonotonic if event occured nearly synchronous with timestamp wrap. 20.4.2011, rapha and tobi
0009 fixed bug in CPLD firmware, syncronization was not working anymore. the master did not output the reset pulse to the slave retinas. 17.5.2010, rapha
0008 the snyc clock to clock a slave retina is now also output in trigger mode. 23.4.2010 rapha 
0007 firmware allows inserting a special trigger event when syncIn pin goes low, 
     enabling of this feature is controlled via FX2 pin PE6 to CPLD. 11.2.2010 tobi (FX2) and rapha (CPLD)
0006 cpld drops events while fx2 fifo is full. 19.6.2009, rapha 
0005 improved biasgen startup and increased firmware bias values. 25.1.2009, tobi
0004 changed clocking scheme to internal 30MHz on FX2, CPLD is clocked from IFclock, 
     because we had a board that did not work reliably with the 48MHz clocking, 12.1.2009, rapha
0003 support USB suspend/resume, 22.7.2008, rapha
0002 corrected error which lead to multiple timestamp resets at startup, 14.7.2008, rapha
0001 downloading default biases on startup, 25.6.2008, rapha
0000 original firmware version

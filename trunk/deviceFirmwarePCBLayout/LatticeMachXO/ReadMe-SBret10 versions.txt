SBret logic versions


SBret10: this logic belongs to the SBret10 test and small boards (rolling shutter)

SBret10_2: this experimental logic belongs to SBret10_2 small boards with two synchronization jacks

SBret10s: this patch logic is only used by one small camera with a problem in nAck and reset signals (it's wired), so in the firmware that signals are interchanged

SBRet20: this is the global shutter logic for SBret20 chips for the test and small boards

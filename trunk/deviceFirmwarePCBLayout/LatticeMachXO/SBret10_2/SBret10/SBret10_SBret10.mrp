Memory Usage
------------

    INFO: Design contains EBR with ASYNC Reset Mode that has a limitation:
    The use of the EBR block asynchronous reset requires that certain timing
    be met between the clock and the reset within the memory block.
    See the device specific data sheet for additional details.

Instance Name: uClockGen/PLLCInst_0
         Type: EHXPLLC

GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The local reset signal 'ResetxRBI_c' of the design has been inferred as
        Global Set Reset (GSR). The reset signal used for GSR control is
        'ResetxRBI_c'.

GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.

Components on inferred reset domain with GSR Property disabled
--------------------------------------------------------------

These components have the GSR property set to DISABLED and are on the inferred
     reset domain. The components will respond to the reset signal 'ResetxRBI_c'
     via the local reset on the component and not the GSR component.

Type and number of components of the type:
   FIFO8KA = 4

Type and instance name of component:
   FIFO8KA : uFifo/AERfifo_0_1
   FIFO8KA : uFifo/AERfifo_0_1
   FIFO8KA : uFifo/AERfifo_1_0
   FIFO8KA : uFifo/AERfifo_1_0

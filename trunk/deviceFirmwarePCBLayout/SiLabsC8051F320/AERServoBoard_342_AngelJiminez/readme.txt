This board design from Angel Jiminez (ajimenez@atc.us.es) is a combined AER interface and servo interface.
It is not yet integrated into jAER and the firmware is not yet developed from other SiLabs firmware combinations.
It uses the SiLabsC8051F340 which has expanded program and RAM memory compared to the C8051F320.

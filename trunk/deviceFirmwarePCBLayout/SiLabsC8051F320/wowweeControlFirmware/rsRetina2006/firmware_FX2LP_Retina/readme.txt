This firmware is a hack on the original Tmpdiff128 CypressFX2 code so that the CypressFX2 could output on a spare port spoofed Robosapiens2 IR control codes.
In this way a PC wired to a retina on the chest of the RS2 could also control the RS2. It was used in Telluride for a walking RS2 project, where the RS2 could see the edge of a table
and not walk over the edge. The idea also was to pen the RS2 inside an arena created by black electrial tape on the floor.

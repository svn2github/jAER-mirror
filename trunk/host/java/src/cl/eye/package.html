Code Laboratories CL Eye Playstation Eye camera wrapper. Runs only under Windows XP/7 32/64 bit.
<p>
 * See <a href="http://codelaboratories.com/research/view/cl-eye-muticamera-api">CodeLaboratories DL Eye Multicam C++ API</a> 
 * for the native API.
<p>
    The Code Laboratories driver is not open-source, and you cannot directly download the driver to install it from an INF file in Windows.
    Instead you download a program that downloads and installs the driver.
<p>This version was tested under CodeLabs Devices/PS3Eye driver version 4.0.2.1017, dated 10/17/2010.</p>
<p>The driver is also available in drivers/ps3EyeCodeLabs for direct installation.</p>
<p>The CLCamera class is the basic hardware interface that configures and opens the PS3Eye camera and delivers frames from it. It is a JNI interface
to the native windows DLL.</p>
